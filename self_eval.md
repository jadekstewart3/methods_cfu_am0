# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

  I feel really confident in the use of built-in Ruby methods. I feel like I have a good understanding of how data will be returned by calling methods, or permantly altered by the use of the "!". I'm finding that it is really fun to manipulate stored data with the use of methods!

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

 I feel fairly confident writing methods of my own. I need to touch the material more. When I started the final practice, I had to re-visit the methods lesson in order to understand the syntax, and get my brain primed to write my own methods. Once I started going with it, it felt really good! I just need more practice, so that I do not have to re-visit the lesson the next time I am writing my own methods.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

Okay, I do have one question. This is specific to writing our own methods. I feel like I have been seeing the use of the (), and the || when writing our own methods. From what I can gather the () are used on single variables, and the || are used when iterating over arrays. Is that correct, or are these two syntaxes interchangable?

### For example:

- Here is a method that I wrote for the final practice:
``` ruby
def square(num)
    puts num ** 2
end

square(3)
```
- only the () are used and if I switched the () with the || the code breaks.

- Here is an example from some method/ iteration practice I was working on:

``` ruby
 animals_arr1 = ["penguin", "zebra", "tiger"]

 def greet_an_animal(animals)
     animals.each do |animal|
        puts "Howdy, lil' #{animal}"
     end
 end

 greet_an_animal(animals_arr1)
```
- Here both are used and the code does not break. 
-Are () used to pass arguments on methods, and || used in the instructions within methods? 

Thank you!
